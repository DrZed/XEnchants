Vorpal : This enchant deals absolute damage (default 1 * level) but the damage bypasses armour this is similar to the way the enchant technically works in lore, though it is supposed to cut through anything which does mean it should insta-kill in the game but I decided too OP for that before even trying...

Vitality : increases max health
